     <h1> Gypsum Valley - Three States Prospect </h1>

          <p>The Gypsum Valley - Three States Prospect (The Prospect) is located on the southwest flank of the Gypsum Valley Salt Anticline in southwest Colorado. The ore target is the Moss Back Member of the Triassic Chinle Formation. At Gypsum Valley, Moss Back lies unconformably on the Permian Cutler Formation. The Triassic Moenkopi formation that was deposited regionally between the Cutler and Mossback is absent at the Prospect. </p>

          <p>An angular unconformity between Cutler and Chinle is believed to have played a central role in the deposition of the Lisbon Valley uranium ore district. In particular, there is a strong correlation of large ore bodies to a belt where well sorted sandstone beds, termed 'sugar sands', unconformably subcrop the Moss Back.

          Lisbon Valley holds one of the largest uranium ore districts in the United States exceeding 60 million pounds of uranium production. Although mined through many adits and shafts, the Lisbon Valley ore workings are nearly continguous separated by only small patches of Moss Back with too little uranium to be economic. Considering reserves and portions missing due to erosion, the uranium ore at Lisbon Valley probably originally exceeded 100 million pounds. This entire amount could be considered to be from a single ore body and as such is likely the largest uranium ore body that has been found in the United States. It is also one of the richest deposits with average grades of about 0.3% U3O8.</p>

          <p>The geologic structure and stratigraphy of the southwest flank of Gypsum Valley is remarkably similar to that of Lisbon Valley. Several moderately sized uranium ore bodies have been discovered in the shallow Salt Wash Member of the Morrison formation along Gypsum Valley; however, no ore has been discovered in the Chinle at Gypsum Valley. Minimal exploration for Chinle ore has been conducted at Gypsum Valley largely because the Chinle targets are in excess of 2000 feet and the Moss Back Member is not well exposed, so its favorability is unknown.  Regional trends suggest it may be thin and unfavorable, lithologically, for uranium deposition; however, these judgements have not been confirmed.</p>

          <p>The rationale for the Prospect centers around stratigraphy encountered in the Three States Natural Gas South Gypsum Valley Unit #1 well (Three States Well) drilled in 1959. The stratigraphy at the Three States Well is complex due to its location on the southwest flank of the Gypsum Valley anticline where beds have been upturned nearly vertical by rising Pennsylvanian salt. Stratigraphic layers differ in thickness by thousands of feet over horizontal distances of less than 1000 feet. Thus, the geologic contacts are difficult to sort out even with the extensive set of geophysical logs available from the Three States well, and drill cuttings. According to Shawe et al. (1968), the base of the Chinle is at 2,370 feet and directly overlays the Cutler Formation with no intervening Moenkopi. The Chinle is 400 to 500 feet thick regionally but only 170 feet thick in the Three States Well due to non-deposition over the rising salt. The potential for a Lisbon-Valley-like unconformity with Moss Back overlying Cutler is high.</p>

          <p>As mentioned, the chance of discovering a large, Lisbon-Valley-like uranium deposit at the Prospect depends on the existence of favorable Moss Back. Stewart et al. (1972) interpreted the northeast depositional limit of the Moss Back to extend northeast of the Lisbon Valley and Dolores Anticlines but slightly southwest of Gypsum Valley. Moss Back outcrops and drill hole data in this region are scarce however.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Other evidence suggests that favorable Moss Back may extend further northeast than shown by Stewart et al. (1972). Uranium ore bodies in the northern portion of the Moab Anticline are in a reduced sandstone/conglomerate unit that is thought to be Moss Back. About 12 miles due west of the Prospect in Summit Canyon, shallow drilling described by Shawe et al. (1968, Plate 2) shows Moss Back directly overlaying Cutler. In an area that was not drilled, they project the top of a Cutler sandstone unit subcropping the Moss Back with angular unconformity. Shawe et al. (1968) indicate that the Slick Rock area is favorable for undiscovered uranium deposits in the Chinle, partly because it likely has a Moss Back Member with similar lithology to that at Lisbon Valley. The Gypsum Valley Anticline is immediately northeast of Shawe's Slickrock District. Well cuttings from the Three States Well were examined. The cuttings contain calcareous granules and green (chemically reduced) sandstone suggestive of Moss Back.

          In summary, the Lisbon Valley uranium ore district and the Gypsum Valley Prospect are located on the southwest flanks of two large Salt Anticlines. The trend of the Lisbon Valley and Gypsum Valley anticlines parallel each other, are oriented northwest-southeast and about 35 miles apart. At the Prospect, Cutler Formation directly underlies Chinle with angular unconformity reminiscent of the geometry at the Lisbon Valley ore district. Stratigraphy in the Three States Well and regional trends indicate that favorable Moss Back may be present in the area. The favorability of the area could be tested with limited drilling slightly downdip from the Three States Well. If this area has favorable Moss Back overalying Cutler sandstone then additional exploration is warranted. </p>
